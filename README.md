This repo will include some preprocessing or processing functions for EEG data.
The functions here will mostly correspond to EEG processing/analysis steps for which I could not find a ready-to-use script in MATLAB, so I had to write them myself.
Hopefully something from this repository can help a bunch of other people with their EEG analysis in the future.
All the functions here are for public use.

I am a PhD student in neuroscience who records and processes 4 different time series data from human subjects:
  1) EEG
  2) ECG
  3) Breathing
  4) Eye-tracking

This repo will include some pre/processing functions for these time series.
Hopefully something from this repository can help a bunch of other people with their EEG analysis in the future.
All the functions here are for public use.
